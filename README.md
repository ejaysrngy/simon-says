# Simon Says Browser Game
<br />
A project from the Web Development course of Angela Yu in Udemy
<br />
The project was completed by only using the starting code, and I tried to finish the code on my own with slight hints to be able to complete some part of the logic that I was struggling with.
<br />
There's still a bug in the code where the previous action would still flash along with the new one, which I have yet to fix as I learn more about Javascript
